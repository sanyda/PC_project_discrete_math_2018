This program contains function that checks if matrix is transitive or not.
Matrix should be inputed as parameter of the function and it should be a list of 0s and 1s starting from the left top, ending on the right botom.
For example:
Matrix
R 1  2  3  4
1 1  0  0  1
2 0  1  1  0
3 1  0  0  1
4 1  1  1  1
should be inputed as the following list [1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]

If matrix is transitive, function returns True. If not
